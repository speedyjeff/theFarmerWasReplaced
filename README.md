# The Farmer Was Replaced

[The Farmer Was Replaced](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The_Farmer_Was_Replaced) is a game where you automate a farming drone with Python.  It was super fun and a strong recommendation.

There are various challenges to unlock - like the snack game and mazes - along with harvesting crops as efficiently as possible.

There were the scripts the were built as the game progressed.  Many assume end-game unlocks (eg. max drones).
